# CONNECT FOUR

This game follows traditional Connect Four rules:

1) A player wins when he/she places four of their own pieces in a row (Horizontally, Vertically, or Diagonally).
2) Players will alternate placing pieces.
3) Once a piece is placed, it can not be removed until the end of the game.

## INSTRUCTIONS TO GET STARTED:

1) Type "make" into the command line.
2) Type "./connectfour" into the command line to execute the program.

## INSTRUCTIONS INSIDE THE PROGRAM:

1) Select the game mode you would like to play. Enter "1" to play against another human. Enter "2" to play against the computer.
2) Enter the number of rows you would like your board to have. (An integer greater than or equal to 4)
3) Enter the number of columns you would like your board to have. (An integer greater than or equal to 4)
* NOTE: For the dimensions, values greater than 40 may worsen the gameplay due to the overlapping of columns.
4) Players will alternate placing pieces by entering the column number of their choosing into the command line.
5) A game ends once a player connects four in a row. If neither player does so before the board is filled to capacity with pieces, then the game ends in a tie.
6) Once the game has ended, enter "1" to play another game, or enter "2" to exit the program.
7) If you have chosen to play another game, continue from instruction 2.
